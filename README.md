# Project Title: Hands-Free Intraoral Electrolarynx

# Project Purpose: 
There are several health conditions that require doctors to perform medical procedures which render unusable a patient’s vocal cords, such as tracheotomy or laryngectomy. Often, such conditions also involve loss of movement or physical restriction of his/her limbs. Due to this, some patients cannot speak nor operate a typical electrolarynx by their own. Many times, an external electrolarynx cannot be used due to the presence of the tracheotomy tube. This can be a risky situation, because if there are any emergencies and the patient is alone, he/she cannot ask for help. The device to be designed addresses the presented problem by delivering a hands-free intraoral electrolarynx, serving as an alternate communication device. This tool will contain a pressure sensor that, by light suction, can activate or deactivate (turn on/off) the device. Patients with mentioned conditions will be provided with the ability to communicate independently whenever they need.
