# Project Title: 
Hands-Free Intraoral Electrolarynx 

# Project Purpose: 
There are several situations or health conditions that require doctors to perform procedures, such as tracheostomy or laryngectomy, which render the patient’s vocal cords unusable.  Such procedures could involve loss of movements or physical restriction of patient’s limbs.  Due to these procedures and medical conditions, some patients cannot speak nor operate a typical electrolarynx on their own.  Many times, an electrolarynx cannot be used due to the presence of tracheostomy tubes.  Not being able to use an electrolarynx to communicate can be a risky situation because, if there are any emergencies, the patient cannot ask for help.  The Hands-Free Intraoral Electrolarynx was developed to address situations such as the described above.  It serves as a communication system for these patients and takes into consideration a target audience that may not be able to move their extremities.  The system contains different modules, such as a Control Module responsible of managing user interactions, a Signal and Tone Generator Module capable of generating a sawtooth signal based on the selected fundamental frequency and producing its sound, and a Power Management Module responsible of energizing the system without being connected to a power outlet.  The designed prototype can be activated/deactivated by a light suction or by using a push button.  However, the universal interface, which is the mono jack, supports other activation/deactivation mechanisms.  The device provides volume control, LED indicators for ON/OFF and pitch, and fundamental frequency variations, which are presented by three pitch options: 120Hz, 200Hz, and 300Hz, such values were established according to the speech physiology.
